A Demo Service Using Jolocom
==================================

The best way to get some hands on experience with the Jolocom library and identity protocol is to try it out for yourself!
In this section we examine how to deploy a demo service capable of interacting with Jolocom identities.
This will require two parts:

1. A `generic backend <https://github.com/jolocom/generic-backend>`_ server.
2. A demo service frontend such as `this <https://gitlab.com/jolocom/municipal-service>`_.

Setting up the backend
#########################################

Documentation regarding setting up and running the generic backend can be found `here <https://jolocom.slite.com/p/note/RGanceZUjeLQZqGxGrpStJ/Introduction>`_.


Setting up the frontend
#########################################

Refer to the repository's `README <https://gitlab.com/jolocom/municipal-service/blob/master/README.md>`_ for information about configuring and running the frontend.
